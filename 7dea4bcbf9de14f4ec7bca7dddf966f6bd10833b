# Configuration via worktree-manager.config.json

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Configuration for pre/post steps could be stored in:
1. Existing worktree-manager.config.json
2. New dedicated lifecycle.json file
3. Per-project .cs-config.json files

## Decision
Extend worktree-manager.config.json with a lifecycle section.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Single config file to manage
- Reuses existing config loading infrastructure
- Users already familiar with this file

### Negative
- Config file grows larger
- Per-project config not supported initially

### Neutral
- Can add per-project config support later
