Hotfix for context exhaustion cascading failure completed

- Limited concurrent subagents to max 2 (hard limit)
- Added context-aware execution mode (throttle as session progresses)
- Added mandatory checkpointing at key triggers
- Added graceful degradation protocol
- Added context exhaustion recovery in artifact verification

...-> Suggest starting new session for remaining work

KEY PRINCIPLE:
Parallelism is GOOD - the fix is checkpointing and graceful degradation,
not artificial limits on concurrency.
