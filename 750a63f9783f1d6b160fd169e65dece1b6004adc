Jumped directly to implementation instead of following planning workflow
## Summary
When `/claude-spec:plan` is invoked with an issue reference, the correct behavior is to follow the full planning protocol (elicitation → research → spec documents), NOT to immediately start implementing the issue's solution.

## Lesson
The `/plan` command produces planning artifacts (REQUIREMENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md). Implementation only happens after `/approve` and `/implement` commands. This is the entire point of the issue #26 - to create explicit gates between phases.
