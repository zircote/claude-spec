- Plugin name: `claude-spec`
- Command prefix: `/cs:*`
- Worktree commands: `/cs:wt:create`, `/cs:wt:status`, `/cs:wt:cleanup`
- Project directory: `docs/spec/active/` (was `docs/architecture/active/`)
- Prompt log: `.prompt-log.json` (hidden)
- Migration: `/cs:migrate` command (no legacy aliases)

### Key ADRs
