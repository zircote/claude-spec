# Claude Spec Plugin - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Extract the architecture planning workflow (`/arch:*`), prompt capture system, and worktree manager into a standalone, distributable Claude Code plugin named `claude-spec`. The plugin provides a complete project specification and implementation lifecycle with:

- Renamed commands (`/cs:*` instead of `/arch:*`)
- Built-in parallel specialist agent orchestration
- Integrated prompt capture for session traceability
- Full worktree management for isolated development
- Dynamic integration with host's CLAUDE.md agent catalog
- Backward compatibility with existing architecture projects

## Problem Statement

### Current State

The architecture planning tools are scattered across multiple locations:
- Commands in `~/.claude/commands/arch/`
- Prompt capture hook patched into hookify plugin
- Worktree manager as a separate skill
- Configuration and state files in various locations

This creates:
1. **Maintenance burden**: Updates require touching multiple locations
2. **Distribution challenges**: Can't easily share with other users
3. **Integration fragility**: Hookify patches break on updates
4. **Unclear boundaries**: Which files belong to architecture workflows?

### Impact

- Cannot distribute architecture workflow to teammates
- Hookify patches lost on plugin updates
- No clear versioning for the architecture toolkit
- Dependencies on host configuration not documented

## Goals and Success Criteria

### Primary Goal

Create a self-contained Claude Code plugin that bundles all architecture planning functionality into a distributable, versioned package.

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Installation success | 100% | Plugin installs via marketplace |
| Command availability | 5 commands | `/cs:p`, `/cs:i`, `/cs:s`, `/cs:c`, `/cs:log` all work |
| Backward compatibility | 100% | Existing `docs/architecture/active/` projects load |
| Prompt capture | Working | Hooks fire on UserPromptSubmit |
| Worktree manager | Full parity | All existing worktree operations work |

### Non-Goals

- Creating new agent definitions (uses host's `~/.claude/agents/`)
- Modifying Claude Code runtime
- Supporting non-Claude-Code environments
- Migrating completed architecture projects

## User Analysis

### Primary Users

- **Claude instances** executing `/cs:*` commands for planning and implementation
- **Developers** using worktree manager for parallel development

### Secondary Users

- **Plugin developers** using this as a reference implementation
- **Teams** wanting to adopt the architecture workflow

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Plugin load time < 100ms
- Hook execution < 5 seconds
- No impact on non-spec Claude operations

### Maintainability

- Single source of truth for all spec workflow code
- Clear directory structure mirroring functionality
- Version-controlled with semantic versioning

### Security

- No secrets in plugin code
- Prompt filters protect sensitive data
- No network calls except when explicitly requested

## Technical Constraints

- Must use Claude Code plugin API (hooks.json, commands/)
- No runtime code modifications
- Must work with existing `~/.claude/agents/` structure
- Must support macOS (primary), Linux (secondary)

## Naming Decisions

| Element | Decision | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Plugin name | `claude-spec` | Matches command prefix |
| Command prefix | `/cs:*` | Short for claude-spec |
| Worktree commands | `/cs:wt:create`, `/cs:wt:status`, `/cs:wt:cleanup` | Full descriptive names |
| Worktree triggers | Keep skill triggers | "spin up worktrees" etc. still work |
| Project directory | `docs/spec/active/` | New location (was `docs/architecture/active/`) |
| Migration | `/cs:migrate` command | One-time script to move old projects |
| Legacy aliases | None | Clean break, no `/arch:*` aliases |
| Prompt log file | `.prompt-log.json` | Hidden file in project dir |
| Capture marker | `.prompt-log-enabled` | Keep current name |

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- Host's `~/.claude/agents/` directory
- Host's CLAUDE.md (for agent catalog reference)
- Host's `~/.claude/worktree-registry.json`

### External Dependencies

- Claude Code plugin runtime
- Git (for worktree operations)
- Python 3 (for hooks)
- jq (for registry operations)
- Terminal app (iTerm2/Ghostty/tmux per config)

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Plugin API changes | Medium | High | Pin to known-working Claude Code version |
| Agent catalog format changes | Low | Medium | Abstract agent lookup logic |
| Worktree registry conflicts | Medium | Medium | Add locking mechanism |
| Hook execution failures | Medium | Low | Graceful degradation (log but don't block) |

## Migration Path

### For Existing Users

1. Install claude-spec plugin
2. Run `/cs:migrate` to move `docs/architecture/` → `docs/spec/`
3. Migration script updates CLAUDE.md references from `/arch:*` to `/cs:*`
4. Old `/arch:*` commands no longer work (clean break)
5. All existing project data preserved in new location

### For New Users

1. Install claude-spec plugin
2. Use `/cs:*` commands directly
3. Projects created in `docs/spec/active/`

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should we support Windows (WSL)?
- [ ] Plugin auto-update strategy?
- [ ] Telemetry/usage analytics (opt-in)?

## Appendix

- FR-000: Worktree prompt logging initialization → FR-103
- FR-000a: Document sync enforcement → FR-024
- FR-000b: Standalone prompt capture plugin → FR-040, FR-041, FR-042
- FR-001 through FR-006: Parallel agent directives → FR-020 through FR-024

### Worktree Manager Attribution

The worktree management functionality is based on the original `~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/` skill. Full credit and attribution will be maintained in plugin documentation.
