title: Command Prefix Rename to cs
---

# Command Prefix Rename (/arch:* → /cs:*)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The plugin needs a command prefix. Options were /arch:*, /spec:*, /cs:*, or /cspec:*.

## Decision
Use /cs:* prefix (short for claude-spec).

## Consequences

### Positive
- Short, easy to type
- Matches plugin name claude-spec
- Distinct from any other Claude Code commands

### Negative
- Requires migration from /arch:*
- Less descriptive than full words
