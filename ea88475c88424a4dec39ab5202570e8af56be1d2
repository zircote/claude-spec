# User Config Location

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The worktree-manager skill needs a stable location for user configuration that survives plugin updates. The current location (plugins/cs/skills/worktree-manager/config.json) is overwritten when the plugin updates.

## Decision
Store user configuration at ~/.claude/worktree-manager.config.json.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Follows Claude Code's existing pattern for user-level config
- Survives plugin updates
- Centralized with other Claude configs
- Easy to back up

### Negative
- Requires migration for existing users (minor)
- Another file in ~/.claude/ directory

### Neutral
- Scripts need modification to look in new location

## Alternatives Considered
1. **~/.config/worktree-manager/config.json**: XDG standard, but doesn't follow Claude's pattern
2. **~/.worktree-manager.json**: Home directory pollution
3. **Environment variables**: More complex, harder to persist
