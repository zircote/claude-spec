title: Shared Team Memory via Git Notes Sync
---

# Shared Team Memory

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Memories could be personal (per-developer) or shared (team knowledge).

## Decision
All memories are shared and sync with the repository via Git notes push/pull.

## Rationale
- Knowledge preservation: Team inherits institutional knowledge
- Onboarding: New members benefit from history
- Consistency: Decisions don't get relitigated
- Collaboration: Shared patterns emerge

## Git Configuration
git config --add remote.origin.push "refs/notes/cs/*:refs/notes/cs/*"
git config --add remote.origin.fetch "refs/notes/cs/*:refs/notes/cs/*"

## Consequences
- Note conflicts possible (use cat_sort_uniq merge)
- Privacy considerations for sensitive decisions
- Everyone sees everyone's memories
