# Dynamic Agent Catalog Integration

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Plugin needs to reference specialist agents. Options:
- Bundle agent definitions in plugin
- Assume host has agents, document as prerequisite
- Dynamically read from host's ~/.claude/agents/

## Decision
Dynamically read from host's ~/.claude/agents/ and CLAUDE.md.

## Consequences

### Positive
- No duplication of agent definitions
- Plugin stays smaller
- Host can customize agents
- Automatic access to any new agents

### Negative
- Plugin depends on host configuration
- Behavior varies based on host setup

### Mitigation
- Document required host configuration in README
- Graceful degradation if agents not found
