title: Index as Derived Data from Git Notes
---

# Index as Derived Data

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The SQLite index could be:
- Source of truth (committed)
- Derived data (gitignored, rebuilt from notes)

## Decision
Treat the index as derived data that can be rebuilt from Git notes at any time.

## Rationale
- No sync issues: Notes are authoritative
- Recovery: Corruption is trivially fixable
- Clean repo: No binary files committed
- Flexibility: Index schema can evolve

## Implementation
.gitignore:
  .cs-memory/

Rebuild:
  /cs:memory reindex

## Consequences
- Index must be rebuilt on clone
- First-run experience needs rebuild
- Notes must contain all necessary data
