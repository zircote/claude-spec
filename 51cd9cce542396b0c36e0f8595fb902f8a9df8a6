# Auto-Capture at 100%

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Memory capture could be manual (explicit command), semi-automatic (prompted), or fully automatic.

## Decision
Implement fully automatic capture during /cs:p, /cs:i, /cs:c workflows with zero manual intervention required.

## Rationale
- Low friction: Developers don't have to remember to capture
- Comprehensive: Nothing falls through the cracks
- Consistent: Standard capture points across projects
- High signal: Captures at meaningful moments

## Capture Points
| Command | Auto-Captures |
|---------|---------------|
| /cs:p | inception, elicitation, research, decisions |
| /cs:i | progress, blockers, learnings, deviations |
| /cs:c | retrospective, learnings, patterns |

## Consequences
- More memories generated (storage growth)
- Potential for noise (need quality filters)
- Must not slow down primary workflow
