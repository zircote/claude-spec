# YAML Front Matter + Markdown Body

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Notes need both machine-parseable metadata and human-readable content.

## Decision
Use YAML front matter (delimited by ---) for structured metadata, followed by Markdown body for content.

## Rationale
- Familiar format: Common in static site generators, docs
- Machine parseable: YAML is structured, typed
- Human readable: Markdown renders nicely
- Flexible: Body can contain any Markdown structure
- Tooling: Many parsers available

## Format Example

type: decision
spec: user-auth
phase: architecture

## Context
[Human-readable context]

## Decision
[Human-readable decision]

## Consequences

- Validation rules for required fields
- Round-trip preservation important
