Completed Task 1.1: Added no-args argument type detection to plan.md
## Summary
Extended the `/claude-spec:plan` command to detect when no arguments are provided and route to the new GitHub Issues workflow.

## Changes Made
- Added `no_args` detection as first check in Step 0 argument parsing (lines 43-46)
- Extended Argument Type Decision Gate with `no_args` case that routes to `<github_issues_workflow>` section (lines 68-72)
- Created new `<github_issues_workflow>` section with complete workflow skeleton including prerequisites check, issue fetching, selection, worktree creation, completeness evaluation, and agent launch (lines 695-800)
