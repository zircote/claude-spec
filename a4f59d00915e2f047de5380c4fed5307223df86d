User wants conventional commit-style branch prefixes
## Context
Instead of a fixed pattern, user wants branch names to match the issue type:
- `feat/123-description` for enhancements
- `bug/123-description` for bugs
- `chore/123-description` for maintenance
- `docs/123-description` for documentation

## Rationale
Aligns with conventional commits workflow and provides semantic meaning in branch names.

API error 400 with "unexpected tool_use_id" indicates conversation state corruption
## Summary
Tool result blocks must reference tool_use blocks from the immediately preceding message. When this invariant is violated, the API rejects the request.

## Common Causes
- Interrupted responses during tool calls
- Context compaction mishandling tool call pairs
- Session resume with incomplete state
