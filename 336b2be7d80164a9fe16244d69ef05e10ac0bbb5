# Security Review as Pre-Step for /cs:c

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Security review could be:
1. A pre-step before /cs:c (audit before close-out)
2. A post-step after /cs:p (audit the plan)
3. A post-step after /cs:c (audit after close-out)
4. Applied to all commands

## Decision
Security review is a pre-step for /cs:c only.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Catches vulnerabilities before project is marked complete
- User can address findings before close-out
- Focused scope (only when closing projects)

### Negative
- Security issues found during planning not caught early
- User must wait for security review before close-out

### Neutral
- Can extend to other commands later based on feedback
