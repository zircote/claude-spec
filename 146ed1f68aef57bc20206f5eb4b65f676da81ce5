# cs-memory Supplements (Not Replaces) Prompt Capture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The claude-spec plugin has two mechanisms for preserving session context:
1. Prompt capture (/cs:log): Raw logging of all user prompts to .prompt-log.json
2. cs-memory: Structured capture of decisions, learnings, blockers, review findings as Git notes

These serve different purposes and the question arose: should cs-memory replace prompt capture?

## Decision
cs-memory supplements prompt capture but does not fully replace it. The two systems coexist with different scopes:

| System | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| cs-memory | Structured knowledge artifacts | Default, always enabled |
| Prompt capture | Debug/troubleshooting, interaction pattern analysis | Optional, enable when needed |

## Rationale
cs-memory captures signal:
- Decisions with context, rationale, alternatives
- Learnings with insight and applicability
- Review findings with severity, remediation, resolution tracking

Prompt capture captures noise + signal:
- Complete transcript (including false starts, corrections)
- Chronological session narrative
- Useful for debugging hooks, validating behavior

## Consequences
- cs-memory becomes the primary knowledge retrieval system
- Prompt capture becomes an optional debug tool
- Reduced storage requirements
- /cs:log remains available for troubleshooting
