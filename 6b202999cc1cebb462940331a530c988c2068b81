Scope decision: Combined spec covering both features
## Summary
User chose to create a single specification covering Issue #25 (checkbox sync) AND detailed argument hinting.

## Rationale
- Both features improve the `/claude-spec:implement` command UX
- Argument hinting also applies to `/claude-spec:plan`
- Single spec reduces overhead for related improvements

## Scope Includes
1. Issue #25: Checkbox sync between PROGRESS.md and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. Richer argument-hint frontmatter fields
3. Improved --help output
4. Better validation error messages

Design decisions captured from user
## Summary
Key design choices for the combined spec established.

## Rationale
User preferences shape the technical approach:
- Immediate sync ensures documents never drift out of sync
- YAML objects are native to command frontmatter, no external files
- Error+suggestion matches CLI best practices (git, npm)

## Decisions Made
1. **Checkbox Sync**: Immediate on task update (no batching)
2. **Hint Format**: Extended YAML object in frontmatter
3. **Validation UX**: Error + suggestion pattern

Approved SPEC-2025-12-25-002 for implementation
## Context
Spec for `/claude-spec:report-issue` command completed planning phase with all required documents, ADRs, and the bonus --no-worktree bug fix.

## Decision
Approved for implementation based on:
- Complete documentation (README, REQUIREMENTS, ARCHITECTURE, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN, DECISIONS)
- Well-defined scope with investigation-first approach
- Low-friction design with opt-out mechanisms
- Integration plan with /plan and /implement
- Bonus bug fix for --no-worktree flag

## Rationale
Spec demonstrates 95%+ confidence with clear requirements, thoughtful architecture decisions, and practical implementation plan. Investigation-first approach provides unique value for AI-actionable issue creation.
