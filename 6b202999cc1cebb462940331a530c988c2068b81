## Changes Made
- Committed and pushed Phases 2-5 implementation (827 insertions across 6 files)
- All 268 tests pass with 95% coverage
- PR #34 is open and ready for review

Simplified over-engineered documentation in implement.md and plan.md
## Summary
Removed ~500 lines of unnecessary pseudocode that documented implementation details Claude already knows. The sections now focus on expected behavior rather than how to implement it.

## Changes Made
- `implement.md argument_schema`: 163 → 30 lines (removed detection algorithm, field tables, upgrade examples)
- `implement.md help_generation`: 144 → 5 lines (removed full pseudocode algorithm)
- `implement.md argument_validation`: 192 → 28 lines (removed Levenshtein implementation, validation pseudocode)
- `plan.md argument_schema`: 103 → 30 lines (removed duplicate documentation)

Fixed `--no-worktree` flag to still create branch when `--no-branch` not set
## Summary
The plan command now correctly creates a `plan/${SLUG}` branch when `--no-worktree` is used alone, only staying on the current branch when `--no-branch` is also specified.

## Changes Made
- Added ELSE clause to branch decision gate in plan.md
- When `NO_WORKTREE=true` and `NO_BRANCH=false`, runs `git checkout -b plan/${SLUG}`
