title: SessionStart for Context Loading
---

# SessionStart for Context Loading (Not Per-Command)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Context loading (CLAUDE.md, git state, project structure) could happen:
1. Once on session start (SessionStart hook)
2. Before each /cs:* command (UserPromptSubmit hook)

## Decision
Load context once on session start via SessionStart hook.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Context loaded immediately, no waiting when first command runs
- Works even if user doesn't run /cs:* commands first
- Lower latency for command execution

### Negative
- Context may become stale during long sessions
- Context loaded even if user won't use cs commands

### Neutral
- Can add refresh mechanism later if needed
