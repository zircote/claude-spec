# Proactive Memory Recall Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Claude Code suffers from context loss after compaction. Without intervention, Claude "strays from documented guidance" and forgets prior decisions.

Two recall approaches were considered:
1. Explicit only: Memories only recalled via /cs:recall command
2. Proactive: System automatically searches for relevant memories during work

## Decision
Implement a two-tier proactive recall strategy:

1. Session awareness (minimal): At session start, notify Claude that memories exist with namespace counts. No content loaded.

2. Topic-based proactive search (on-demand): When Claude works on a topic, proactively search for relevant memories and suggest them. Non-blocking, dismissible.

## Rationale
- Minimal awareness prevents drift: Claude knows to search before making decisions
- Proactive search reduces friction: No need to remember to run /cs:recall
- Non-blocking preserves flow: Suggestions don't interrupt primary workflow
- Progressive revelation: Summary -> full content only when needed

## Consequences
- Additional hook integration required
- Topic detection logic needs careful tuning to avoid noise
- Must not slow down primary workflow
- Balances awareness with context window preservation
