title: Worktree Commands with Skill Triggers
---

# Worktree Commands Structure

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Worktree manager functionality could be exposed as:
- Skill triggers only ("spin up worktrees")
- Explicit commands (/cs:wt:*)
- Both

## Decision
Both - skill triggers AND explicit commands.

Commands:
- /cs:wt:create - Create worktrees with agents
- /cs:wt:status - View worktree status
- /cs:wt:cleanup - Clean up worktrees

## Consequences

### Positive
- Flexibility for different user preferences
- Discoverability via /help
- Natural language still works

### Negative
- More commands to maintain
- Potential duplicate code paths
