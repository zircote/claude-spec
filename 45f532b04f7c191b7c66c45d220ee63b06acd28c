summary: Use PROGRESS.md as Single Source of Truth
phase: architecture
tags:
- arch-lifecycle-automation
- adr
- architecture
- ci-cd
---

## Context
Implementation state needs to be tracked across multiple documents (README.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, CHANGELOG.md). We need to decide where the authoritative state lives.

Options considered:
1. Distributed state: Each document owns its own state
2. Central state: One file is authoritative, others are derived
3. External state: JSON/database file separate from markdown

## Decision
Use a new `PROGRESS.md` file as the single source of truth for all implementation state. Other documents are synchronized from PROGRESS.md.

## Alternatives Considered
- Distributed state
- JSON/database file

summary: Hybrid Checkpoint System for Context Loading
phase: architecture
tags:
- arch-lifecycle-automation
- adr
- architecture
- ci-cd
---

## Context
When `/arch:i` starts, it needs to provide Claude with implementation context. We need to decide how much to load and how.

Options considered:
1. Full document load (all planning docs into context)
2. Condensed brief (summary only)
3. Progressive loading (current phase detail + overview)
4. Reference mode (lazy loading on demand)
5. Hybrid checkpoint (brief + persistent PROGRESS.md)

## Decision
Use Hybrid Checkpoint System: Load a condensed implementation brief at startup, maintain state in PROGRESS.md that persists across sessions.

## Alternatives Considered
- Full document load
- Condensed brief only
- Progressive loading
- Reference mode

summary: Auto-Detect Project from Branch Name
phase: architecture
tags:
- arch-lifecycle-automation
- adr
- architecture
- git
- ci-cd
---

## Context
When user runs `/arch:i`, we need to determine which architecture project to work on. Options:

1. Always require explicit project ID argument
2. Auto-detect from current git branch
3. Interactive selection from active projects
4. Combination with fallback chain

## Decision
Auto-detect project from current git branch name, with explicit argument as override and interactive selection as fallback for ambiguous cases.

Detection logic:
1. If explicit argument provided, use it
2. Parse current branch name (e.g., `fix/arch-commands` → `arch-commands`)
3. Search `docs/architecture/active/*/README.md` for matching slug
4. If multiple matches, prompt user to select
5. If no matches, provide helpful error

## Alternatives Considered
- Always require argument
- Interactive selection only

summary: Hierarchical Status Rollup
phase: architecture
tags:

- adr

---

## Context
We need to determine project and phase status from granular task states. How should rollup work?

Options:
1. Per-task only (no aggregation)
2. Per-phase only
3. Per-deliverable
4. Hierarchical (task → phase → project)

## Decision
Use hierarchical rollup: Task completion rolls up to phase progress, phase completion rolls up to project status.

Rollup rules:
- Phase progress = (done + skipped) / total tasks
- Phase status: pending → in-progress (first task starts) → done (all tasks done/skipped)
- Project status: draft → in-progress (first task starts) → completed (all phases done)

## Alternatives Considered
- Per-task only
- Per-phase only
- Per-deliverable

summary: Divergence Tracking with User Notification
phase: architecture
tags:
- arch-lifecycle-automation
- adr
- architecture
- ci-cd
---

## Context
Implementation often diverges from plans: tasks get added, skipped, or modified. How should we handle this?

Options:
1. Silently update the plan
2. Block divergence (force adherence to plan)
3. Track and flag for user review
4. Track and auto-approve
5. Track, flag, and allow user to approve/reject

## Decision
Track divergences in PROGRESS.md Divergence Log, notify user, and allow them to approve or flag for review. Divergences don't block progress but are explicitly recorded.

Divergence types: `added`, `skipped`, `modified`, `reordered`
Resolution states: `approved`, `flagged`, `pending-review`

## Alternatives Considered
- Silent updates
- Block divergence
- Track and auto-approve

summary: Use Opus 4.5 Model for `/arch:i`
phase: architecture
tags:
- arch-lifecycle-automation
- adr
- architecture
---

## Context
The existing `/arch` commands use a model tiering strategy:
- `/arch:p` (planning): Opus 4.5 (complex reasoning)
- `/arch:s` (status): Sonnet (simpler operations)
- `/arch:c` (close): Sonnet (simpler operations)

What model should `/arch:i` use?

## Decision
Use Opus 4.5 for `/arch:i` because it requires:
- Intelligent detection of task completion from implementation work
- Context synthesis across multiple planning documents
- Nuanced divergence detection and user communication
- Complex state management and rollup calculations

## Alternatives Considered
- Sonnet
- Hybrid (Sonnet + escalate to Opus)

- `/cs:wt:create` - Create worktrees with agents
- `/cs:wt:status` - View worktree status
- `/cs:wt:cleanup` - Clean up worktrees

summary: Use NDJSON for Log Format
phase: architecture
tags:

---

## Context
The log file needs to store multiple entries over time, potentially across many sessions. We need a format that supports:
- Atomic appends without reading/rewriting the entire file
- Resistance to corruption (one bad entry shouldn't invalidate all data)
- Easy parsing for analysis
- Human readability for debugging

## Decision
Use NDJSON (Newline-Delimited JSON) format where each line is a self-contained JSON object.

## Alternatives Considered
- JSON Array
- SQLite
- Plain text

## Context
Need to capture Claude's responses for complete interaction logging, but full responses are too verbose (often 1000+ words). Options for summarization:
- Use LLM to summarize (adds latency, cost)

## Decision
Use heuristic-based summarization: extract first paragraph, key bullet points, truncate to 500 characters.

## Alternatives Considered
- LLM summarization
- Full response logging
- No response capture
