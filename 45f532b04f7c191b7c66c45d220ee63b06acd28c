## Context
Implementation state needs to be tracked across multiple documents (README.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, CHANGELOG.md). We need to decide where the authoritative state lives.

Options considered:
1. Distributed state: Each document owns its own state
2. Central state: One file is authoritative, others are derived
3. External state: JSON/database file separate from markdown

## Decision
Use a new `PROGRESS.md` file as the single source of truth for all implementation state. Other documents are synchronized from PROGRESS.md.

## Alternatives Considered
- Distributed state
- JSON/database file
