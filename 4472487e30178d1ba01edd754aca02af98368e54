# No Legacy Aliases

## Status
Accepted

## Context
During migration, we could provide /arch:* aliases that redirect to /cs:* commands.

## Decision
No aliases - clean break from old commands.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Simpler codebase
- No ambiguity about which commands are current
- Forces complete migration

### Negative
- Existing workflows break immediately
- Muscle memory adjustment required

### Mitigation
- /cs:migrate command updates CLAUDE.md references
