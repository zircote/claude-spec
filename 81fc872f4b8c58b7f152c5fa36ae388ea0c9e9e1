summary: Auto-detect trigger for GitHub Issues workflow

Auto-detect trigger for GitHub Issues workflow
## Context
User chose to have the workflow trigger when `/plan` is run with no arguments, offering to fetch issues as an option. This keeps the command surface minimal while making the feature discoverable.

## Rationale
- Avoids command proliferation (no new command to learn)
- Natural entry point when user doesn't have a specific idea
- Existing `/plan <idea>` workflow remains unchanged
- Progressive disclosure - only shows issues option when relevant
