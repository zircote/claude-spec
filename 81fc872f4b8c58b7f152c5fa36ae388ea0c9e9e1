Completed Task 1.1: Added no-args argument type detection to plan.md
## Summary
Extended the `/claude-spec:plan` command to detect when no arguments are provided and route to the new GitHub Issues workflow.

## Changes Made
- Added `no_args` detection as first check in Step 0 argument parsing (lines 43-46)
- Extended Argument Type Decision Gate with `no_args` case that routes to `<github_issues_workflow>` section (lines 68-72)
- Created new `<github_issues_workflow>` section with complete workflow skeleton including prerequisites check, issue fetching, selection, worktree creation, completeness evaluation, and agent launch (lines 695-800)

Extracted GitHub Issues bash functions into testable scripts with comprehensive test suite
## Summary
Moved all embedded bash scripting for the GitHub Issues Worktree Workflow from `commands/plan.md` into separate, testable scripts in `scripts/github-issues/`. Created a 47-test validation suite.

## Changes Made
- Created `scripts/github-issues/check-gh-prerequisites.sh` - Verify gh CLI, auth, and repository
- Created `scripts/github-issues/get-branch-prefix.sh` - Map labels to conventional commit prefixes
- Created `scripts/github-issues/generate-branch-name.sh` - Generate branch names from issue data
- Created `scripts/github-issues/create-issue-worktree.sh` - Create worktree with issue context
- Created `scripts/github-issues/post-issue-comment.sh` - Post clarification comments to GitHub
- Created `scripts/github-issues/build-issue-prompt.sh` - Build agent prompt with issue context
- Created `scripts/github-issues/tests/test_github_issues.sh` - Comprehensive test suite
- Updated `commands/plan.md` to reference extracted scripts instead of inline functions

Completed Task 1.1: Added no-args argument type detection to plan.md
## Summary
Extended the `/claude-spec:plan` command to detect when no arguments are provided and route to the new GitHub Issues workflow.

## Changes Made
- Added `no_args` detection as first check in Step 0 argument parsing (lines 43-46)
- Extended Argument Type Decision Gate with `no_args` case that routes to `<github_issues_workflow>` section (lines 68-72)
- Created new `<github_issues_workflow>` section with complete workflow skeleton including prerequisites check, issue fetching, selection, worktree creation, completeness evaluation, and agent launch (lines 695-800)

- Task 1.2: Enhanced prerequisites checker with detailed error messages and decision gates
- Task 1.3: Implemented issue fetching with dynamic `gh` command building
- Task 1.4: Added label filter support via `gh label list` and multi-select UI
- Task 1.5: Added assignee filter with `@me` option
- Task 2.1: Filter Selection UI completed as part of Task 1.3

Completed Phases 1-3 (Tasks 1.1-3.6) of GitHub Issues Worktree Workflow
## Summary
Implemented the complete core functionality for the GitHub Issues workflow in plan.md. The workflow now includes:
- No-args detection and routing
- Prerequisites checking (gh CLI, auth, repo)
- Filter selection (labels, assignee)
- Issue fetching with dynamic commands
- Issue selection with pagination
- Branch name generation with conventional commit prefixes
- Worktree creation with issue context
- Completeness evaluation with AI assessment
- Comment drafting and posting
- Parallel agent launch

## Changes Made
- Phase 1: Argument detection, prerequisites, issue fetching
- Phase 2: Issue selection UI, label-to-prefix mapping, branch naming, worktree creation, agent launch
- Phase 3: Completeness evaluation criteria, decision flow, comment drafting/posting

Extracted GitHub Issues bash functions into testable scripts with comprehensive test suite
## Summary
Moved all embedded bash scripting for the GitHub Issues Worktree Workflow from `commands/plan.md` into separate, testable scripts in `scripts/github-issues/`. Created a 47-test validation suite.

## Changes Made
- Created `scripts/github-issues/check-gh-prerequisites.sh` - Verify gh CLI, auth, and repository
- Created `scripts/github-issues/get-branch-prefix.sh` - Map labels to conventional commit prefixes
- Created `scripts/github-issues/generate-branch-name.sh` - Generate branch names from issue data
- Created `scripts/github-issues/create-issue-worktree.sh` - Create worktree with issue context
- Created `scripts/github-issues/post-issue-comment.sh` - Post clarification comments to GitHub
- Created `scripts/github-issues/build-issue-prompt.sh` - Build agent prompt with issue context
- Created `scripts/github-issues/tests/test_github_issues.sh` - Comprehensive test suite
- Updated `commands/plan.md` to reference extracted scripts instead of inline functions

Completed code cleanup: 7 findings fixed (1 CRITICAL, 5 HIGH, 1 MEDIUM)
## Summary
Ran `/claude-spec:code-cleanup` with 6 parallel specialist agents analyzing security, performance, architecture, quality, testing, and documentation. Fixed all critical and most high-priority issues.

## Changes Made
- **SEC-001 (CRITICAL)**: Added JSON structure validation in `create-issue-worktree.sh` to prevent command injection
- **SEC-002 (HIGH)**: Used `printf` with proper quoting in `generate-branch-name.sh` for safe title processing
- **SEC-003 (HIGH)**: Added branch name regex validation before git commands
- **SEC-005 (MEDIUM)**: Added canonical path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **QUAL-003 (HIGH)**: Added named constants `MAX_DECODED_LENGTH`, `MIN_BASE64_SEGMENT_LENGTH` in pipeline.py
- **DOC-001 (HIGH)**: Updated CLAUDE.md with current active spec project
