User wants conventional commit-style branch prefixes
## Context
Instead of a fixed pattern, user wants branch names to match the issue type:
- `feat/123-description` for enhancements
- `bug/123-description` for bugs
- `chore/123-description` for maintenance
- `docs/123-description` for documentation

## Rationale
Aligns with conventional commits workflow and provides semantic meaning in branch names.
