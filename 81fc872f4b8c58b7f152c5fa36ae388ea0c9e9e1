Auto-detect trigger for GitHub Issues workflow
## Context
User chose to have the workflow trigger when `/plan` is run with no arguments, offering to fetch issues as an option. This keeps the command surface minimal while making the feature discoverable.

## Rationale
- Avoids command proliferation (no new command to learn)
- Natural entry point when user doesn't have a specific idea
- Existing `/plan <idea>` workflow remains unchanged
- Progressive disclosure - only shows issues option when relevant

AI-evaluated issue completeness with user override
## Context
User wants Claude to assess whether an issue has sufficient detail to begin planning elicitation with reasonable confidence. The threshold is practical: "can we start meaningful requirements elicitation?" rather than a rigid checklist.

## Rationale
- Flexible assessment rather than boolean checkbox requirements
- User retains final judgment with 4 options: post clarification, add details inline, proceed anyway, skip
- Professional tone for GitHub comments maintains project credibility
- User MUST have option to request Claude draft a clarification comment
