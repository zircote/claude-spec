# Project Directory Rename

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Projects were stored in docs/architecture/active/. With the rename, options were:
- Keep old location (backward compatible)
- Rename to docs/spec/active/ (consistent branding)
- Use hidden .claude-spec/ directory

## Decision
Rename to docs/spec/active/ with one-time migration via /cs:migrate.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent with claude-spec branding
- Cleaner naming
- docs/spec/completed/ for archives

### Negative
- Requires explicit migration step
- Git history shows file moves (not deletes)
