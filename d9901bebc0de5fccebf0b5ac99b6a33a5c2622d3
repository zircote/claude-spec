# Code Review Findings as Commit-Anchored Notes

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The existing /cr command produces CODE_REVIEW.md, REVIEW_SUMMARY.md, and REMEDIATION_TASKS.md artifacts. These are markdown files that exist independently of Git history.

## Decision
Code review findings are captured as Git notes in the cs/reviews namespace, attached to the commit being reviewed. This provides:
1. Semantic searchability via embeddings
2. Pattern detection across reviews
3. Resolution tracking (status: open -> resolved)
4. Team-wide knowledge sharing via Git notes sync

## Format
---
type: review_finding
severity: critical|high|medium|low
category: security|performance|architecture|quality|tests|documentation
file: <file-path>
line: <line-number>
summary: <one-line description>
status: open|resolved
---
<full finding details with remediation guidance>

## Rationale
- Commit anchoring: Findings attach to the code state that caused them
- Pattern detection: Searching cs/reviews reveals recurring issues
- Resolution tracking: Status updates preserve remediation history
- Supplements artifacts: CODE_REVIEW.md still generated for human consumption

## Consequences
- Each finding becomes a separate note
- Resolution requires updating existing notes
- Review patterns can inform proactive suggestions
