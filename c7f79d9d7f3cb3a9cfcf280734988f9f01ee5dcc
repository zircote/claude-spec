# Interactive Setup via AskUserQuestion

## Status
Accepted

## Context
First-time users need to configure worktree-manager, but editing JSON files manually is tedious and error-prone.

## Decision
Use Claude's AskUserQuestion tool to interactively gather configuration preferences during first-time setup or when /cs:wt:setup is run.

## Consequences

### Positive
- User-friendly experience
- Validates choices against known options
- Leverages Claude's native UI capabilities
- No external dependencies

### Negative
- Requires Claude Code context (can't run standalone)
- Limited to pre-defined options plus "Other"

### Neutral
- Setup only runs when needed (missing config or explicit command)

## Alternatives Considered
1. **CLI prompts (readline/fzf)**: Requires additional tools, different UX
2. **Web UI**: Overkill for simple config
3. **Just use defaults**: Loses personalization benefit
