# Strict Phase Separation - /cs:p NEVER Implements

## Status
Accepted

## Context
During specification work, Claude incorrectly proceeded to implementation after the user said "approve work", interpreting approval of the spec as authorization to implement. This highlighted a critical gap: no explicit boundary between planning and implementation phases.

Options:
1. Trust Claude to interpret user intent correctly (status quo)
2. Add explicit guards in command files to enforce phase boundaries
3. Require separate confirmation before implementation

## Decision
Enforce strict phase separation through command file modifications:
- /cs:p includes post_approval_halt section that HALTS after spec approval
- /cs:i is the ONLY authorized entry point for implementation
- Plan approval explicitly does NOT authorize implementation

## Consequences

### Positive
- Eliminates ambiguity between plan approval and implementation authorization
- Prevents unauthorized implementation
- User maintains explicit control over when implementation begins
- Clear audit trail (user must explicitly run /cs:i)

### Negative
- Extra step required to start implementation
- User cannot say "approve and implement" in one command

### Neutral
- Aligns with separation of concerns principle
- Similar to how code review approval doesn't auto-merge
