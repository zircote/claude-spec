# Fail-Open Design for All Hooks

## Status
Accepted

## Context
When hooks encounter errors, they could:
1. Fail-open (log error, continue with command)
2. Fail-closed (block command execution)
3. Prompt user to decide

## Decision
All hooks follow fail-open design - errors are logged to stderr but never block command execution.

## Consequences

### Positive
- User workflow never blocked by hook failures
- Aligns with existing prompt_capture.py pattern
- Graceful degradation

### Negative
- User might miss important errors
- Silent failures possible

### Neutral
- Errors logged to stderr for debugging
