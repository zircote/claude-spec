Scope decision: Combined spec covering both features
## Summary
User chose to create a single specification covering Issue #25 (checkbox sync) AND detailed argument hinting.

## Rationale
- Both features improve the `/claude-spec:implement` command UX
- Argument hinting also applies to `/claude-spec:plan`
- Single spec reduces overhead for related improvements

## Scope Includes
1. Issue #25: Checkbox sync between PROGRESS.md and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. Richer argument-hint frontmatter fields
3. Improved --help output
4. Better validation error messages
