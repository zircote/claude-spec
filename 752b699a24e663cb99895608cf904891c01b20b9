Scope decision: Combined spec covering both features
## Summary
User chose to create a single specification covering Issue #25 (checkbox sync) AND detailed argument hinting.

## Rationale
- Both features improve the `/claude-spec:implement` command UX
- Argument hinting also applies to `/claude-spec:plan`
- Single spec reduces overhead for related improvements

## Scope Includes
1. Issue #25: Checkbox sync between PROGRESS.md and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. Richer argument-hint frontmatter fields
3. Improved --help output
4. Better validation error messages

Design decisions captured from user
## Summary
Key design choices for the combined spec established.

## Rationale
User preferences shape the technical approach:
- Immediate sync ensures documents never drift out of sync
- YAML objects are native to command frontmatter, no external files
- Error+suggestion matches CLI best practices (git, npm)

## Decisions Made
1. **Checkbox Sync**: Immediate on task update (no batching)
2. **Hint Format**: Extended YAML object in frontmatter
3. **Validation UX**: Error + suggestion pattern
